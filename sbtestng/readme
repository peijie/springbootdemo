This demo shows how to use testNG in spring boot applications. The following is the steps:

1. Add two dependencies in build.gradle
	testCompile('org.testng:testng:6.9.13.6')
	testCompile('org.assertj:assertj.core')

2. Intellij is not updating the dependency libraries automatically. You need to synchronize the Intellij with gradle by
    clicking the Refresh All button on Gradle projects

3. Make the test class extends from AbstractTestNGSpringContextTests

4. Remove Annotation "@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)" from the test class

5. Create a resources folder under src/test

6. Create testNG configuration file under the resources folder. The file name can be any name. Usually it is testng.xml
